# rmenu

A [wmenu](https://codeberg.org/adnano/wmenu)-style dynamic menu for Wayland,
written in Rust.

`rmenu` is a layer-shell dropdown menu: type to filter, arrows to move,
Enter to select, Escape to cancel. It renders text entirely in software
(wl_shm + its own rasterizer), so there are no cairo/pango dependencies —
the whole UI is drawn by `ab_glyph`.

## Features

- wmenu/dmenu-style filtering: every space-separated query token must be a
  substring; ranking is exact > prefix > substring
- lists stream in: the menu shows immediately and rows fill in as stdin
  produces them (and while `--run` scans `.desktop` files and `$PATH`), so slow
  producers (`find / | rmenu`) stay responsive
- `Ctrl`-free text input, `Up`/`Down`/`Ctrl-n`/`Ctrl-p`/`PgUp`/`PgDn`/`Home`/`End` navigation, key
  repeat, long-list scrolling, case-insensitive matching (`-i`), `Tab` completes
  the highlighted entry into the input; `Ctrl-c`/`Ctrl-g` cancel, `Ctrl-h`
  backspace, `Ctrl-j`/`Ctrl-m` accept, `Ctrl-u` clears the line, `Ctrl-w` kills
  the last word, `Shift-Return` submits exactly what was typed, and
  `Ctrl-Return` multi-selects (prints each pick, keeps running)
- Spotlight-style UI: rounded corners; launch shows only the input bar in the
  upper-center of the screen, results appear as you type, and the menu
  collapses back to the bar when the query is cleared. Height changes ease over
  120 ms instead of jumping
- text is antialiased with LCD subpixel filtering on 1× outputs (sharper on a
  normal-DPI screen) and neutral grayscale AA on HiDPI, where subpixel only
  costs time and adds colour fringes
- `--run` launcher mode: scans `.desktop` files and launches the selection
  via `sh -c` — and merges in everything on `$PATH`, deduped with the desktop
  entries winning. Hidden entries, `Terminal=true` entries, entries for other
  desktops (`OnlyShowIn`/`NotShowIn`), and non-executable PATH files are
  skipped; a localized `Name[locale]` is preferred when it matches the locale.
- one panel per Wayland session: launching `rmenu` again dismisses the running
  menu (same as Escape, no output, exit 1) instead of stacking a second bar on
  top of the first — so a launcher keybind toggles open/closed
- CJK text renders (auto-picks a CJK-capable system font)

## Build / run

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Modes:

```sh
# stdin → menu → selection printed to stdout
printf 'firefox\nFirefox\nalacritty\n' | rmenu

# launcher (desktop entries + PATH scripts/commands)
rmenu --run

# with filters
printf 'alacritty\nfirefox\n' | rmenu -i -p 'run: '
```

Options (wmenu-compatible subset): `-b` (menu at screen bottom), `-P` (mask typed
input as asterisks), `-i` (case-insensitive), `-l lines` (visible rows), `-W width`,
`-p prompt`, `-o output` (show on the named output), `-f font.ttf|"FAMILY [style] [pt|Npx]"` (bare size is points, `Npx` is
pixels — wmenu/Pango convention), `-v` (print version), `--run`, `-h`.

Colors are wmenu-style `RRGGBB[AA]`: `-N` normal bg, `-n` normal fg, `-M` prompt bg,
`-m` prompt fg, `-S` selection bg, `-s` selection fg. Example:

```sh
printf 'alacritty\nfirefox\n' | rmenu -N 111111 -n cccccc -S 005577 -s ffffff
```

### Sway

```conf
set $menu rmenu --run
bindsym $mod+d exec $menu
```

## Manual

`docs/rmenu.1` is a roff manual page. View it with `man ./docs/rmenu.1`, or
install it with
`install -Dm644 docs/rmenu.1 /usr/share/man/man1/rmenu.1`.

## Known limits

- No IME: typing CJK into the filter field needs a Wayland input-method
  protocol client, same as wmenu. Filtering CJK *labels* works fine.
- Long stdin lists are capped at 64 visible rows and scroll (keeps the shm
  buffer bounded); pass `-l N` for a fixed height.
- No xdg-activation token on launch (`--run`); windows may not grab focus on
  some compositors.
- Fractional output scaling (1.25/1.5) renders at the output's integer scale;
  HiDPI integer scales (2x) render natively crisp.
- Subpixel antialiasing assumes an RGB-stripe panel. On a BGR panel (text
  fringing on the wrong side) set `main::TEXT_AA` in `src/main.rs` to
  `render::Subpixel::Bgr`, or to `Gray` to disable it everywhere.
